        <p> Just for today I will take care of my body. I will exercise it, care for it, nourish it, not abuse it or

          mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought, and concentration. Just for today I will
          exercise my soul in three ways; I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out. I will do at least 2
          things I don’t want to do, as William James suggests, just for exercise(“Everybody should do at least two
          things each day that he hates to do, just for practice.”)</p>
